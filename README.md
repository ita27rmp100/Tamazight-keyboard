# Tamazight-keyboard
In this project, I'm about to create a keyboard for Kabyle language.

## Overview :
  The idea of this project is to create a keyboard that support Tamazight langauge with the kabyle letters that Mouloud Mameri invented the previous centuary.
      There are two types of keyoards in this project :
        **-1- CustomKeyboard :** to write in kabyle using the prephirical keyboard.
        **-1- On-Screen-keyboard :** GUI keyboard that works like the original on-screen-keyboard of windows, but to write kabyle Tamazight letters.
## Kabyle Alphabet
The Kabyle language uses the following Latin-based characters (including additional letters for specific sounds):
- **Vowels**: a, e, i, u  
- **Consonants**: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z  
- **Additional letters** for native sounds:
  - **ɣ** (voiced uvular fricative)
  - **ḥ** (voiceless pharyngeal fricative)
  - **ṛ** (retroflex r)
  - **ṣ** (emphatic s)
  - **ṭ** (emphatic t)
  - **ẓ** (emphatic z)
  - **ɛ** (voiced pharyngeal fricative)
  - **ḍ** (emphatic voiced alveolar stop / pharyngealized d)
  - **ǧ** (voiced postalveolar affricate)
  - **č** (voiceless postalveolar affricate)

> This set covers all letters used to write modern Kabyle in Latin script.
