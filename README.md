# Tamazight-keyboard
In this project, I'm about to create a keyboard for Kabyle language.

## Overview :
  The idea of this project is to create a keyboard that support Tamazight langauge with the kabyle letters that Mouloud Mameri invented the previous centuary.
      There are two types of keyoards in this project :
        **-1- CustomKeyboard :** to write in kabyle using the prephirical keyboard.
        **-1- On-Screen-keyboard :** GUI keyboard that works like the original on-screen-keyboard of windows, but to write kabyle Tamazight letters.
## Kabyle Alphabet
The Kabyle language uses the following Latin-based characters (including additional letters for specific sounds):
- **Vowels**: a, e, i, u  
- **Consonants**: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z  
- **Additional letters** for native sounds:
  - **ɣ** (voiced uvular fricative)
  - **ḥ** (voiceless pharyngeal fricative)
  - **ṛ** (retroflex r)
  - **ṣ** (emphatic s)
  - **ṭ** (emphatic t)
  - **ẓ** (emphatic z)
  - **ɛ** (voiced pharyngeal fricative)
  - **ḍ** (emphatic voiced alveolar stop / pharyngealized d)
  - **ǧ** (voiced postalveolar affricate)
  - **č** (voiceless postalveolar affricate)

> This set covers all letters used to write modern Kabyle in Latin script.
## Examples about this project :

## What I have learnt from this project :
- How to handle with keyboard and plyer library.
- Reminder about tkinter (It's been a long time since I have used it lst time before this project)
- New knowledge about Tamazight language.
## Notes :
- The project isn't perfect, and as non-tamazight speaker, you may find some issues or you see some changes should be added in the project to present better the culture of the speakers of this langauge.
- I distributed the Tamazight letters in keyboard according to specificvision I saw, if you have another formal way to ditribute it, **fork** the project and edit it, I will be happy to see your contribution.
- You will clearly notice that the On-screen-keyboard doesn't work 100% effective, it should writes in the previous focused slot not in an Entry slot in the GUI itself, I tried to do that but I didn't know/find how, So I invite you to add this feauture.
