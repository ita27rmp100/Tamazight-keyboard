In this project, I'm about to create a keyboard for Kabyle language.


## Kabyle Alphabet

The Kabyle language uses the following Latin-based characters (including additional letters for specific sounds):

- **Vowels**: a, e, i, u  
- **Consonants**: b, d, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, z  
- **Additional letters** for native sounds:
  - **ɣ** (voiced uvular fricative)
  - **ḥ** (voiceless pharyngeal fricative)
  - **ṛ** (retroflex r)
  - **ṣ** (emphatic s)
  - **ṭ** (emphatic t)
  - **ẓ** (emphatic z)

> This set covers all letters used to write modern Kabyle in Latin script.
